越野心理学
比尔巴克斯顿 
 
介绍
当我们听到体育的心理学时，通常想到的是与比赛前的心理准备有关。例如，我们都见过有关如何“积极思考”，或如何处理神经，压力或兴奋等技巧的书籍或文章，否则这些内容可能会对我们的表现产生负面影响。
更不为人知的是，还有另一个心理学领域可以应用于骑行。它被称为认知心理学。这是关心我们如何思考，学习和解决问题的心理学领域。了解其中的一些基础知识可以为我们在竞争中遇到的许多问题提供见解。值得注意的是，我们可以利用这些见解来调整我们的培训方案，以避免将来出现这些问题。

这篇文章的出现是为了理解我自己的骑错误（其中有很多）。在我的非马术生活中，我是一位科学家，研究人们在学习如何使用计算机，传真机和复印机等技术时遇到的问题。我的信念是，我在科学中观察到的许多东西同样适用于骑行。

在这个阶段，人们可能会问，“学习骑乘的过程与学习文字处理器有什么关系？” 乍一看，几乎没有相似之处。但经过反思，他们的共同之处在于，两者都与获得新技能有关。 
 

技能和问题解决
骑术是一种技巧。学骑是技能获取。但是，为什么在“学骑”的时候使用这样的花哨术语似乎没有问题呢？毕竟，它更加脚踏实地。我的主要原因是与骑行本身有点距离，以便我们可以专注于学习部分。
一般来说，如果有人告诉我他们想要的东西，我想他们知道它是什么。如果你想要一个缰绳，你可以很清楚地向我描述它。但是如果你想要一个技巧，你能描述一下这个细节的意义吗？然而，这不是缰绳一样重要的技能吗？要了解你对技能的了解，让我给你一个简单的测试：

在阅读之前，想一想，告诉我技能的相反之处是什么？

我甚至会给你一个提示：我不是在寻找“不熟练的”。

预期的答案是“解决问题”。现在，如果这是你的回应，那么你可能不需要阅读这篇文章。另一方面，如果这看起来像是一个奇怪的答案，那么坚持下去 - 以下可能对你有用。 
 

自动和注意行为
任何熟练的表演，无论是马术，音乐还是数学，最重要的特点是它是自动的。也就是说，执行这项任务的人已经做了很多次，之后他们就不必在做这件事的时候专注于它。正如我们将来会看到的那样，最重要的结果就是心智可以专注于其他事情（例如，而不是思考“我的脚后跟，眼睛，......”？自由思考，“下一跳的最佳线路在哪里？”）。
测试一个人是否真的擅长任务的一个好方法是看他们是否可以同时做其他事情。一些骑乘教练最喜欢的例子是让学生在跳过的同时背诵一些困难的东西（例如乘法表或拼写他们的名字）。这是一个很好的测试。如果学生擅长跳跃，头脑可以自由地关注背诵。否则，这两项任务将互相干扰，其中一项或两项都会受到影响。

执行我们不熟练的任务需要细心的行为。我们必须考虑完成任务所需的所有小步骤。还记得当你不熟练的小跑吗？花了你所有的精力来保持平衡，并在马上。直到这变成自动的，你的思想才能充分释放，才能让你开始关注你所处的对角线。而现在，你甚至不必考虑你的对角线。它也是自动的。这是你关注的节奏和速度。随着技能的发展，之前需要关注的问题（以及解决问题）现在变成了自动化。因此，头脑被释放，以便它能够处理一组新的问题（这些问题本身将随着实践而自动化）。 
 

实践权力法
对于我来说，我认为获得一项新技能，比如骑马，最令人沮丧的是我知道我应该做什么。我阅读了所有的书籍，杂志，并观看了顶级车手。但是当我骑上马时，我无法把它放在一起。
这只是一种说法，认为获得任何技能都很困难。如果我们知道有什么关于学习新技能的知识，那么发展它并保持它的唯一方法就是练习：一遍又一遍地做，然后再做一些。认识到这一点，导致我们成为一名优秀教练的关键之一：能够让你在一段时间内做一些事情的人，同时保持新鲜，有趣和具有挑战性（对于你和你的马 - 谁也在获得新技能）。

现在当我一遍又一遍地说，我的意思是说有多少“过剩”？那么，这是表达在一个所谓的实践法则。简单地说，这表示如果需要2个小时才能完成一个步骤，需要两个步骤需要4个小时，三个步骤需要8个小时，4个步骤需要16个小时，等等。当然，这是一个泛化。要传达的信息是，奥运代表队的车手们已经投入了不可思议的时间，在这个水平上，技术的每一次进步都需要花费大量的时间来完成。 
 

任务干扰及其避免
“干扰”是我之前用来描述试图在与另一个任务同时执行一项任务时导致性能下降的原因的术语。当不同的任务竞争相同的有限资源或注意力时，干扰就会产生。请记住，如果我不擅长任务，它的表现需要细心解决问题。因此，可能没有足够的处理能力来同时执行额外的解决问题所需的其他任务，而我也不熟练。
现在让我们看看这是如何影响我们的马术活动，比如在越野赛道上跳跃。在这种情况下，有人可能会说我们需要执行至少三项不同的任务：

基本的马术：简而言之，我们需要保持我们的马位于平衡位置，同时在不平坦和陌生的地形上驰骋。
回答要求每个具体跳跃的问题：在精心设计的课程中，每个跳跃旨在提出骑手的具体问题 - 难度取决于竞争水平的问题。
导航课程：我们需要记住我们打算遵循的课程和具体路线，我们所有人都在这个部门犯了错误。

这里任务干扰的可能性非常大。如果我专注于留在自己的马上，那么当我到达那里时，我不会准备好处理下一次跳跃的具体问题。如果我在跳过跳跃时没有考虑下一步要去哪里（因为我专注于跳跃跳跃本身），那么在我开始思考我的计划课程之前，我会远远超过它。而且因为在跳跃之后我发现自己脱离了计划的过程，所以引入了调整计划的问题，这让我的思维脱离了基本的平衡，这意味着我会进入下一个跳跃平衡。循环继续 - 希望没有下降。

在我们跑步之后，我们不可避免地问自己：“出了什么问题？这是怎么回事？我走完了路线，我可以自己处理任何跳跃，而且我可以在这个地形上跑动！” 当然，所有这些都可能是真实的。但是我们似乎慢慢欣赏的是，从心理上来说，把所有三者结合在一起是完全不同的事情，而不是孤立地做每一件事情。这种情况类似于许多想成为音乐家的人遇到的情况：他们可以唱歌词，他们可以在吉他上弹奏伴奏，但他们不能一起完成这两首歌。在这两种情况下，问题都是经典的任务干扰。 
 

实践，准备和速度
从心理学的角度来看，“把它放在一起”意味着每个任务都有足够的技能，有充足的认知资源可以在没有干扰的情况下处理每个任务。现在至少有三种策略可以用来把我们带到这个国家：
1. 实践：这是明显的策略。正如我们前面所讨论的那样，练习是技能获取的关键，而技巧则是从细心的，要求苛刻的问题解决转向自动任务执行。

2. 准备：无论我们多么熟练，意想不到的事情都将不可避免地发生。由于下大雨，您可能会发现自己站立不稳，与您或您的马匹遇到过的任何事物不同。你可能会在你从未期待过的组合中获得一次跳出。在这些和许多类似的情况下，你（通常突然）面临着“额外”的问题。这里的心理危险是，这个“意外”问题可能会造成额外的认知需求，干扰其他正在进行的任务的执行，并产生额外问题的连锁效应。

在这种情况下最小化干扰的关键在于理解意外和意外之间的差异！仅仅因为脚踏实地或跑步意外并不意味着我们不应该计划出现这种可能性。尽管有一个舒适的室内舞台，我们应该定期在最悲惨的天气下在外面上课，穿越国家和体育场。这样，当天气意外不好时，我们准备应对冷手指，滑缰绳，可见度差和光滑的脚步。如果（如果）在竞争中遇到相同的条件，最终的练习意味着更多的技能和更少的干扰。

同样，如果我们意外地在组合中或其他情况下遇到了问题，我们可以通过准备将其后果降到最低。即使我们希望清楚，我们应该为每个围栏制定一个“计划B”（和“C”，“D”......）。对于我们可以预见的一个可能的问题，每一个都是有计划的回应。这些计划中的一部分可以在家中练习，其他则不行。这个计划是你在走路的主要任务之一。如果你已经做好了计划，那么当（不是如果）发生“意外”时，你就会做好准备。你将会有更少的问题需要解决。因此，对其他任务的干扰将会减少，损害将被包含在内。您可以继续前进，并在赛道的其余部分骑行，而不会产生可能发生的连锁效应。

3. 速度：在我们可以做的改善我们的表现的所有事情中，减缓速度可能是减轻最小痛苦的最大收获。所有新手都听说过这个主题的变化，但速度过快仍然是人们看到的问题中最常见的原因之一。现在注意我说速度不是问题，而是原因。什么是底层心理学？

在物理世界中，我们习惯于根据他们在给定的时间单位内能够做多少来描述机器的性能。因此，我们说汽车可以每小时行驶几英里，电动机以每分钟很多转速行驶，或者发电机每小时可以提供这么多千瓦。为了我们的目的，让我们以同样的方式来思考大脑。让我们说，我们的大脑可以一分钟回答X个问题（或解决X个问题）。让我们进一步假设在两次跳跃之间骑行时，我们需要回答Y个问题。如果我在没有回答所有Y的问题的情况下进行第二次跳跃，我可能会遇到问题。我可以轻松避免这种情况。通过延长两跳之间的时间，我为自己买了时间。因此，我在第二次跳跃时回答了所有Y个问题，并且不太可能犯错。

越野速度通常以米/秒为单位。从心理学的角度来看，更值得我们用每米回答的问题思考它。由于技巧的原因，专家可以更迅速地回答更多问题，因此可以在更短的时间内安全地覆盖相同的距离，但是在距离上回答了至少相同数量的问题！作为新手，我们的目标应该是匹配专家的回答问题，而不是速度。这不仅会带来更多干净的回合，还会带来更安全，更愉快的回合。

一个重要的警告：对我所说的话有明显的限制，否则合乎逻辑的结论是，静坐不动，让世界上所有的时间都在解决问题，这将是一个完美回合的肯定途径。请记住，以适当的速度接近围栏并在时间限制内轮到你是必须考虑的两个关键问题。一切都有限制！
 

按时间顺序与感知时间
在物理世界和时间顺序的算术中，如果我只回答两个围栏之间所要求的一半问题，结论可能是为了回答所有问题，我应该把速度减半（即双倍跳跃之间的时间量）。这是一个好消息：感知时间不遵循时间顺序的规则。其中最有趣的一件事情是，它只需要大约10％的时间，或多或少地将可用的问题解决时间加倍！当然，情况正好相反：如果你只加快10％，你就冒险减少了可以回答的问题数量。速度增加10％左右，差错的难度和可能性翻倍。切割速度提高10％左右，你的清晰度会提高一倍（只要你还记得我的警告）。在这里做出正确的决定并不是火箭科学：如果你目前遇到麻烦的话，速度降低10％会很有意义。 
 
概要
骑行时我们都解决问题。（如果问题解决的数量可以忽略不计，那么我们的竞争力远远低于我们的能力，应该上升到一两个水平。）我们遇到麻烦的地方是当我们变得超负荷时，解决一个问题的心理努力需要干扰解决与其他任务相关的问题的思想。
通过实践，我们可以在尽可能多的领域建立我们的技能水平。这样做，这些任务的执行将会自动完成。因此，他们不会干涉与其他任务相关的问题解决。

通过准备，我们可以预料到意外。通过这样做，我们可以为任何可能发生的事件准备好“配方”。通过这样做，我们消除了“即时”配制食谱的需要。通过减少意外情况所要求的问题解决量，我们可以减少任务干扰的数量，否则会导致任务干扰，从而降低连锁效应的可能性。如果发生什么事情，我们会按计划处理，然后继续我们的其余行程。

最后，通过控制我们的速度，我们花费时间来回答所有在障碍障碍过程中所要求的问题。通过认识到心理时间不是线性的，我们可以利用这个事实，即它只需要大约10％的减速时间来加倍解决问题的时间。

骑马与身体活动同样重要。要有效和安全地骑车，需要了解这两个组件。希望这个讨论能够澄清心理方面的问题，并且使解决所有这些问题的过程不会干扰他们最重要的任务：享受这项运动。

The Psychology of Cross Country
Bill Buxton 
 
Introduction
When we hear about the psychology of sport, what generally comes to mind has to do with the mental preparation before a competition. For example, we have all seen books or articles that give techniques on how to "think positive," or how to handle nerves, stress or the excitement that might otherwise have a negative impact on our performance.
What is less known is that there is another area of psychology that can be applied to riding as well. It is known as cognitive psychology. This is the area of psychology concerned with how we think, learn, and solve problems. Understanding some of its basics can provide insights to many of the problems that we encounter in competition. Significantly, we can make use of these insights in adjusting our training regimen so as to avoid those problems in the future.

This article grew out of trying to understand my own riding mistakes (of which there are many). In my non-equestrian life, I am a scientist who studies the problems that people have in learning how to use technologies such as computers, fax machines and photocopiers. My belief is that much of what I observe in my science applies equally to riding.

At this stage, one might ask, "How does the process of learning to ride relate to learning a word processor?" At first glance, there is little similarity. But on reflection, what they have in common is that both have to do with the acquisition of a new skill. 
 

Skill and Problem Solving
Riding is a skill. Learning to ride is skill acquisition. But why use such fancy terminology when "learning to ride" seems to do just fine? After all, it is far more down to earth. My main reason is to get a bit of distance from riding per se so that we can concentrate on the learning part.
Generally, if someone tells me they want something, I assume that they know what it is. If you want a bridle, you can probably describe it to me quite clearly. But if you want a skill, can you describe what that means to the same level of detail? Yet isn't that skill at least as important as the bridle? To find out what you do know about skill, let me give you a simple test:

Before reading on, think for a moment, and tell me what is the opposite of skill?

I'll even give you a hint: I'm not looking for "unskilled."

The intended answer is, "problem solving." Now if that was your response, then you probably don't need to read this article. On the other hand, if this seems like a strange reply, then stick around - what follows may be of use to you. 
 

Automatic and Attentive Behaviour
The most important characteristic of any skilled performance, be it equestrian, musical or mathematical, is that it is automatic. That is to say, the person performing the task has done it so many times before that they literally don't have to concentrate on it while doing it. As we shall see even more later, the most important consequence of this is that the mind is therefore freed to concentrate on other things (for example, rather than thinking "are my heels down, eyes up, ...?" the mind is free to think about, "where is the best line to the next jump?").
A good way to test if someone is really skilled at a task is to see if they can do something else at the same time. A favorite example some of riding instructors is to have a student recite something difficult (such as multiplication tables or spelling their name backwards) while going over a jump. This is an excellent test. If the student is skilled at jumping, the mind will be free to focus on the recitation. If not, the two tasks will interfere with one another, and either or both will suffer.

Performing a task in which we are unskilled requires attentive behaviour. We have to think of all of the little steps that it takes to get through the task. Remember when you were unskilled at rising trot? It took all of your concentration to stay balanced and on the horse. It wasn't until this became automatic that your mind was sufficiently freed up to enable you to begin to pay attention to what diagonal you were on. And now, you don't even have to think of your diagonal. It too is automatic. It's your rhythm and pace that you're concentrating on. As skill develops, what previously required attention (and problem solving) now becomes automatic. Thus, the mind is freed so that it can attend to a new set of problems (which themselves will become automatic with practice). 
 

The Power Law of Practice
For me, I think that the most frustrating thing about acquiring a new skill, such as riding, is that I know intellectually what I am supposed to do. I read all the books, magazines and watch the top riders. But when I get on a horse, I just can't put it all together.
This is just a round about way of saying that acquiring any skill is hard. And if there is anything that we know about leaning a new skill, it is that the only way to develop it and keep it is to practice: do it over and over and over again, then do it some more. Recognizing this leads us to one of the keys to a good instructor: someone who can have you do something over an over again while keeping it fresh, interesting and challenging (for you and your horse - who is also acquiring new skills).

Now when I say over and over again, just how many "overs" do I mean? Well, this is expressed in something called the power law of practice. Simply stated, this says that if it takes 2 hours to get one step, it will take 4 hours to get two steps, 8 hours to get three steps, 16 hours to get 4 steps, etc. Of course this is a generalization. The message to take away is that those riders on the Olympic team have put in an unbelievable number of hours, and at that level, every incremental improvement in technique comes at the cost of a large number of hours of practice. 
 

Task Interference, and its Avoidance
"Interference" is the term that I used earlier to describe the cause of any degradation in performance that results from an attempt to perform one task at the same time as another. Interference results when different tasks compete for the same limited resources, or attention, of the brain. Remember, if I'm unskilled at a task, its performance demands attentive problem solving. Consequently, there is likely not enough processing power left to simultaneously perform the additional problem solving required by some other task in which I am also unskilled.
Now let us see how this affects us in an equestrian activity, such as riding a jump on a cross country course. In this case, one could argue that we need to perform at least three different tasks:

Basic equitation: Simply put, we need to stay on our horse in a balanced position, while galloping over uneven and unfamiliar terrain.
Answer the question demanded each specific jump: In a well designed course, each jump is designed to ask a specific question of the rider - a question whose difficulty is determined by the level of competition.
Navigate the course: We need to remember the course and the specific line which we plan to follow, and all of us have made mistakes in this department.

The potential for task interference here is immense. If I am preoccupied with staying on my horse, I won't be prepared to deal with the specific problem of the next jump when I get there. And if I'm not thinking about where I go next while going over the jump (because I'm preoccupied with riding the jump itself), I will be well beyond it before I get my mind back to riding my planned course. And because I consequently found myself off of my planned course after the jump, the problem of adjusting my plan is introduced, which takes my mind off of basic equitation, which means I get to the next jump off balance. And the cycle continues - hopefully without a fall.

After our run we inevitably ask ourselves, "What went wrong? How did that happen? I walked the course. I can handle any of the jumps on their own. And I certainly can canter over that terrain!" Of course, all of that may well be true. But what we seem slow to appreciate is that, psychologically, doing all three together is a very different thing than doing each in isolation. The situation is similar to one that many would-be musicians have encountered: they can sing the lyrics and they can play the accompaniment on guitar, but they can't do the two together. In both cases, the problem is classic task interference. 
 

Practice, Preparation and Speed
"Putting it all together," from the psychological perspective means being sufficiently skilled in each of the tasks that there are sufficient cognitive resources to deal with each without interference. Now there are at least three strategies that can be applied to bring us to this state:
1. Practice: This is the obvious strategy. As we have discussed earlier, practice is the key to skill acquisition, and with skill comes the transition from attentive, demanding problem solving to automatic task performance.

2. Preparation: No matter how skilled we are, the unexpected will inevitably occur. Due to heavy rain, you may find yourself on footing unlike anything you or your horse have ever encountered. You may get a run-out in the middle of a combination where you never expected it. In these, and many similar situations, you are (often suddenly) confronted with an "extra" problem. The psychological danger here is that this "unexpected" problem may make extra cognitive demands which interfere with the performance of other ongoing tasks, and have the knock-on effect of causing additional problems.

The key to minimizing interference in these kinds of circumstances lies in appreciating the difference between unexpected and unplanned! Just because the footing or a runnout is unexpected does not mean that we should not have planned for the eventuality. Despite having a cozy indoor arena, periodically we should school dressage, cross country and stadium outside in the most miserable weather. That way, we are prepared to deal with cold fingers, slippery reins, poor visibility and slick footing when the weather is unexpectedly bad. The resulting practice means more skill and less interference when (not if) these same conditions are encountered in competition.

Likewise, when we unexpectedly get a run-out in the middle of a combination or in some other situation, we can minimize the consequences through preparation. Even though we expect to go clear, we should have a "Plan B" (and "C," "D," ...) for each fence. Each is a planned response to a possible problem that we can anticipate. Some of these plans can be practiced at home, others not. This planning is one of your main tasks in walking a course. If you've done your planning well, then when (again, not if) the "unexpected" happens, you will be ready. You will have fewer problems to solve. Consequently, the interference with other tasks will be reduced and the damage will be contained. You can get on and ride the rest of the course without the knock-on effects that might otherwise occur.

3. Speed: Of all of the things that we can do to improve our performance, perhaps slowing down is the one that gives the most gain for the least pain. All novices have heard variations of this theme before, yet excessive speed is still one of the most common causes for problems that one sees on course. Now notice that I said speed was not the problem, but the cause. What is the underlying psychology?

In the physical world, we are used to describing the performance of machines in terms of how much they can do in a given unit of time. Hence, we say that a car can go so many miles per hour, a motor run at so many revolutions per minute, or a generator provide so many kilowatts per hour. For our purposes, let us think of the brain in the same way. Let us say that our brain can answer X questions (or solve X problems) a minute. Let us further assume that in riding between two jumps, we need to answer Y questions. If I get to the second jump without answering all Y questions, I am likely going to have a problem. I can avoid this easily. By stretching out the time between the two jumps, I buy myself time. I therefore arrive at the second jump with all Y questions answered, and am far less likely to make an error. (Recalling all of the alternate plans for the upcoming fence are, of course, some of the questions that are required during the approach.)

Cross country speeds are normally given in metres per second. Of far more value, from the psychological perspective, would be for us to think of it in questions answered per metre. Because of skill, the expert can answer more questions more rapidly, and therefore safely cover the same distance in a shorter time, but having answered at least the same number of questions over the distance! As novices, our goal should be to match the question answering, not the speed, of the expert. This leads not only to more clean rounds, but safer and more enjoyable rounds as well.

One important caveat:  there are obvious limits to what I am saying, otherwise the logical conclusion would be that sitting still, giving yourself all the time in the world to problem solve, would be the sure path to a perfect round.  Keep in mind that approaching a fence at the proper pace and making your round within the  time limit are two of the key problems that you have to take into account.  There are limits to everything!
 

Chronological vs Perceptual Time
In the arithmetic of the physical world and chronological time, if I only answered half of the questions demanded of me between two fences, the conclusion might be that in order to answer them all, I should cut my speed in half (that is, double the amount of time between jumps). Here is the good news: perceptual time does not follow the rules of chronological time. One of the most interesting things about it is that it only takes about 10% more time, to more-or-less double the available problem solving time! Of course, the opposite is also true: if you speed up by only 10%, you run the risk cutting the number of questions that you can answer in half. A speed increase of about 10% comes close to doubling the difficulty and likelihood of error. Cutting speed by 10% about doubles your chances of going clear (as long as you also keep in mind my caveat, above). Making the right decision here isn't rocket science: a 10% reduction in speed makes a lot of sense if you are currently having troubles going clear. 
 
Summary
We are all problem solving when riding. (If the amount of problem solving is negligible, then we are competing well below our ability and should move up a level or two.) Where we get into trouble is when we become overloaded, and the mental effort of solving one problem makes demands on the mind which cause interference with solving the problems associated with some other task.
Through practice, we can build up our level of skill in as many areas as possible. In so doing, the performance of those tasks will become automatic. Consequently, they will not interfere with problem solving associated with other tasks.

Through preparation we can anticipate the unexpected. In so doing, we can have a prepared "recipe" for each eventuality that might occur at any point on course. By so doing, we eliminate the need to "make up" the recipe on the fly. By reducing the amount of problem solving demanded by unexpected situations, we reduce the amount of task interference compared to what would otherwise result, and therefore reduce the likelihood of knock-on effects. If something happens, we deal with it according to plan, then get on with the rest of our ride.

Finally, by controlling our speed, we buy ourselves time to answer all of the questions demanded from obstacle to obstacle on course. By recognizing that psychological time is not linear, we can take advantage of the fact that it only requires about a 10% slow-down to double the problem solving time available.

Riding is as much a mental as a physical activity. To ride effectively and safely requires an understanding of both of these components. Hopefully this discussion has shed some light on the mental side, and makes it so that the process of solving all of these problems does not interfere with the most important task of them all: enjoying the sport.
